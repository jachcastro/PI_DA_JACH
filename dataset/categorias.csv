However, this may soon change with the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research.

Terra’s network token is LUNA which powers the entire ecosystem. Unlike most blockchains, Terra’s ecosystem includes a native algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). A decentralized network with its own decentralized currency is a very attractive thesis for both users and developers. More dApps are being built on Terra, especially DeFi protocols which are now commonly known as TeFi.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8284/small/01_LunaClassic_color.png?1653547790', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12681/small/UST.png?1653548090', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3246/small/Nash_M.png?1680864855']",,2023-03-17T09:10:32.057Z
xdai-ecosystem,Gnosis Chain Ecosystem,,,"Formerly the xDai Chain, The Gnosis chain is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum but uses a different consensus algorithm - Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Stake DAO (POSDAO).

polygon-ecosystem,Polygon Ecosystem,,,"Polygon, formerly known as Matic, was originally meant to be a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum to improve transaction throughput and speed. However, it has since become more popular as a stand-alone blockchain, with its own native projects and decentralized applications. Major DeFi protocols such as Aave and Curve have also found second homes on Polygon. Unlike Ethereum, Polygon operates on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in which network participants can stake the network’s native MATIC tokens to validate transactions and participate in voting and other governance decisions. Polygon also hosts its own bridge that allows users to transfer assets from Ethereum to Polygon and vice versa.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/325/small/Tether.png?1668148663', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/825/small/bnb-icon2_2x.png?1644979850', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/small/USD_Coin_icon.png?1547042389']",,2023-08-08T16:01:22.743Z

binance-smart-chain,BNB Chain Ecosystem,,,"BNB Chain is an alternative blockchain that is similar to Ethereum, capable of hosting smart contracts and decentralized applications. It was launched by Binance in September 2020 as the Binance Smart Chain, and relaunched in Feburary 2022 as BNB Chain. BNB uses the Proof-of-Staked-Authority model which has allowed for low transaction fees and higher throughput. 

Compared to Ethereum which would usually cost hundreds to make a few transactions, BNB only charges less than a few dollars. BNB supports the BEP-20 token format, which is essentially the same format as ERC-20 but on a different chain, and transaction fees are paid in Binance’s native exchange token, BNB.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/325/small/Tether.png?1668148663', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/825/small/bnb-icon2_2x.png?1644979850', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/small/USD_Coin_icon.png?1547042389']",,2023-08-21T14:11:09.544Z

Polkadot’s infrastructure begins with the relay chain, which acts as the central chain. Each chain that runs on Polkadot is called a parachain as they run parallel to the main relay chain, and is built on top of the relay chain. Besides parachains, projects can participate in the Polkadot ecosystem for a shorter fixed period of time through parathreads. Blockchains built on top of Polkadot’s own relay chain are also interoperable with blockchains that have vastly different technology stacks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin through bridges.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12171/small/polkadot.png?1639712644', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/877/small/chainlink-new-logo.png?1547034700', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22617/small/astr.png?1642314057']",,2023-03-17T09:10:37.149Z
