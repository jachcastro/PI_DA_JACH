solana-ecosystem,Solana Ecosystem,,,"Solana is a general purpose blockchain similar to Ethereum. The underlying architecture is different, such that developers have to write applications using Rust instead of Solidity or Vyper. However, this may soon change with the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi applications on Solana is Serum, built by the team behind FTX.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/325/small/Tether.png?1668148663', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/small/USD_Coin_icon.png?1547042389', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4128/small/solana.png?1640133422']",,2023-03-17T09:10:31.171Z

dot-ecosystem,Polkadot Ecosystem,,,"Polkadot is a blockchain protocol designed to support multiple purpose-built blockchains under one unified network. Polkadot’s infrastructure begins with the relay chain, which acts as the central chain. Each chain that runs on Polkadot is called a parachain as they run parallel to the main relay chain, and is built on top of the relay chain. Besides parachains, projects can participate in the Polkadot ecosystem for a shorter fixed period of time through parathreads. Blockchains built on top of Polkadot’s own relay chain are also interoperable with blockchains that have vastly different technology stacks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin through bridges.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12171/small/polkadot.png?1639712644', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/877/small/chainlink-new-logo.png?1547034700', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22617/small/astr.png?1642314057']",,2023-03-17T09:10:37.149Z
binance-smart-chain,BNB Chain Ecosystem,,,"BNB Chain is an alternative blockchain that is similar to Ethereum, capable of hosting smart contracts and decentralized applications. It was launched by Binance in September 2020 as the Binance Smart Chain, and relaunched in Feburary 2022 as BNB Chain. BNB uses the Proof-of-Staked-Authority model which has allowed for low transaction fees and higher throughput. 

Compared to Ethereum which would usually cost hundreds to make a few transactions, BNB only charges less than a few dollars. BNB supports the BEP-20 token format, which is essentially the same format as ERC-20 but on a different chain, and transaction fees are paid in Binance’s native exchange token, BNB.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/325/small/Tether.png?1668148663', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/825/small/bnb-icon2_2x.png?1644979850', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/small/USD_Coin_icon.png?1547042389']",,2023-08-21T14:11:09.544Z
